CHANGES:

* Uses xml.etree.ElementTree rather than text mangling

* Encoding and version are now optional (defaulting to utf-8 and 1.0)

* Unless the encoding is altered, the XML prefix won't be included (it's optional anyway)

* Cases such as namespace handling have been removed for now (to be reintroduced via full qnames)

* Added some doctests
